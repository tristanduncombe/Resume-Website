Within Aviation, the first priority is always safety; yet, when we look at airports across the United States of America we can see a worrying trend; a substancial increase in runway incursions.
A runway incursion is when an aircraft enters a runway when it is already occupied, or will be occupied.
One such instance occured at John F. Kennedy International Airport (KJFK).

Not the instance you were thinking about - that is the concern. Runway incursions at US airports have become an alarming statistic, with these events increasesing 189% between 2010 and 2018 at US airports[1].
With over 1800 incursions occuring a year, we ought to question what has occured to bring such a drastic rise to these runway incursions.

With modern surface radars (ASDE-X) and runway status lights (RWSLs), the rate at which runway incursions are occuring should be decreasing. Surface radars in conjuction with runway status lighting should ensure that air traffic control are aware of all surface movements with very high accuracy, and pilots should know when they are cleared to enter a runway, so how is it possible for runway incursions to still occur?

## It shouldn't be possible, and yet it does, so what causes this?
