        <p>
          Hi I'm Tristan, I'm a Third Year Bachelor (Honours) & Master of
          Software Engineering Student and I am working casually as a Software
          Engineering Intern for Boeing Defence Australia. Currently I have a
          significiant amount of experience in front-end web-development, in
          Vue/React/Knockout, but I want to eventually move into lower level
          programming as I wish to work with Flight Computers and Avionics
          eventually. I have significant experience within coorporate and formal
          environments as well as working as a team to develop, facitilate, and
          produce, documents, courses and training materials. Through my
          experience I have build a significant amount of knowledge of the
          aerospace sector and the many companies and projects within. I have a
          significant amount of leadership and teamwork experience through my
          volunteering experience. This builds into my desire to eventually lead
          projects and teams on projects. I have grown up into leadership and it
          is a passion. As the Queensland Group Training Officer, I work to
          ensure that the leaders of tomorrow are taught in an informative
          manner.
